1. 'IGROV1_example_no_growth_thresholds.ipnyb' is an example of a model built with no growth thresholds, constrained for media conditions and gene expression data (CCLE; 2020). Gene expression and media conditions are cell line-specific, according to 'media_subtype_site_growth_all_datasets.xls' supplementary file. Corresponds to Results 3.2.
2. 'IGROV1_example_with_growth_thresholds.ipnyb' is an example of a model built with growth thresholds, according to cell line-specific experimnetal data. Constrained for media conditions, gene expression data (CCLE; 2020) and these groth thresholds. Details and references for media conditions and experimental growths included in 'media_subtype_site_growth_all_datasets.xls' supplementary file. Corresponds to Results 3.2.
